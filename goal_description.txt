Part 1: 
I want a chatbot that answers only based on all techcrunch articles and nothing else and whose knowledge base increases with every new article. It has to provide a link to the source of its claims.

Part 2:
I want an app which summarizes techcrunch posts: Each post will have the original TechCrunch title, photo, but only a summary of its contents.
